Thanks to great work from a lot of contributors we are finally releasing version
1.0.0 of munit. This was long time coming and finally we are out of milestones
and ready for a new chapter of munit.

## Important changes

### Async support for fixtures

Previously, it was not possible to create fixtures that loaded asynchronously.
It was possible to work around this limitation on the JVM by awaiting on
futures, but there was no workaround for Scala.js. Thanks to
[@olafurpg](https://github.com/olafurpg) we now have support to return futures
(and anything that converts to futures) from the
beforeAll/beforeEach/afterEach/afterAll methods.

### Introduce "strict equality" mode for asserts

Previously, MUnit had a subtyping constraint on assertEquals(a, b) so that it
would fail to compile if a was not a subtype of b. This was a suboptimal
solution because the compile error messages could become cryptic in some cases.
Additionally, this API didn't integrate with other libaries like Cats that has
its own cats.Eq[A,B] type-class.

Now, MUnit uses a new munit.Compare[A,B] type-class for comparing values of
different types. By default, MUnit provides a "universal" instance that permits
comparison between all types and uses the built-in == method. Users can
optionally enable "strict equality" by adding the compiler option
"-Xmacro-settings.munit.strictEquality" in Scala 2. In Scala 3, we use the
Eql[A, B] type-classes instead to determine type equality (per
http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/multiversal-equality.html)

Change introduced by [@valencik](https://github.com/valencik)

### Make printers more easily configurable

MUnit uses its own `Printer`s to convert any value into a diff-ready string
representation. The resulting string is the actual value being compared, and is
also used to generate the clues in case of a failure.

The default printing behaviour can be overriden for a given type by defining a
custom `Printer` and overriding `printer`.

More details can be found
[here](https://scalameta.org/munit/docs/tests.html#customize-value-printers)

### Diff module extracted to a separate module

Thanks to [@majk-p](https://github.com/majk-p) it's now possible to use munit's
diff module separately from the test framework.

If using sbt it's available as:

```
libraryDependencies += "org.scalameta" %% "munit-diff" % "1.0.0"
```
